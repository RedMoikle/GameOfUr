# Game of Ur in Maya

This is a recreation of my very first Python project. While learning the language,
I created a playable board game inside of Maya, based on the ancient Mesopotamian "Royal Game of Ur".

This game uses API callbacks placed on automatically generated Maya objects to interact with the game code.
